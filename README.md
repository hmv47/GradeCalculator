# Student final grade calculator

A program written in C++ to calculate the final mark of students using the formula:

    FinalMark = 0.4 * HomeworkMark + 0.6 * ExamMark



## Functions:

 - Entering the name of the student
 - Entering or generating as many marks as the user wants
 - Choosing to enter more students if so wished
 - Choosing the final mark either calculated by median of homework mark or by the mean average of homework mark
 - Reading data from file

## Installation and usage:

 1. Download a [release](https://github.com/hmv47/GradeCalculator/releases)
 2. Get a C++ compile (e.g. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)) or use an IDE such as CodeBlocks or Visual Studio
 3. Choose either array.cpp or vector.cpp and compile it (the only difference is the datatype used to store homework grades)
 4. Compile the program (e.g. if using gcc and compilng array.cpp the command is "g++ array array.cpp")
 5. Run the file in the terminal using ./array (or array.exe if using Windows)
 6. Follow on screen instructions

## Versions:
